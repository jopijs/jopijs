# Using Tailwind CSS

## What is Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a set of utility CSS classes, the use of which avoids the use of CSS styles. The particularity of Tailwind is that it offers a very large number of utility CSS classes, but it only includes the ones you use.

This feature allows the generated style sheets to remain small and optimized. The trade-off is that Tailwind must scan your code and analyze what it uses, which implies a sometimes tedious configuration step: which is not the case with Jopi, because **Tailwind is already configured and enabled by default**.

## Disable Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is already configured and enabled. If its use is not suitable for your project, then here is how to disable it from the **index.ts** file at the root of your project:

**Disabling Tailwind**
```typescript
jopiEasy
  .configure_tailwindProcessor()
  .disableTailwind();
```

## Define the "global.css"

The Tailwind engine needs a `global.css` file to work, which it will look for on startup.

This file is automatically generated by Jopi, by concatening intelligently all the `global.css` files found into each module directory.

```
|- package.json
|- global.css               < Build by Jopi
|- src/
    |- mod_module1/
        |- global.css       < Concat his content
    |- mod_module2/
        |- global.css       < Concat his content
```

When concatenating the `global.css` files, Jopi removed the `@import` statements which are already found. For exemple if more than one file include `@import "tw-animate-css";` then it's inserted only once.
