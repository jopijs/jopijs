## 🚀 What is JopiJS?

JopiJS is a high-performance framework inspired by Next.js, built on top of **Bun.js** (and compatible with **Node.js**) and **React**. It brings the familiar developer experience of file-based routing and Server Side Rendering (SSR), but with a core re-engineered for absolute speed.

### Key highlights:
- ⚡ **Turbocharged Performance**: Up to **7.5x faster** than Next.js (and **2.5x faster** in Node.js mode) thanks to an advanced automatic caching engine.
- 🧩 **Modular Architecture**: A powerful plugin system that allows you to extend or override any part of the framework without touching the core code.
- 🛠️ **Developer Experience (DX)**: Built-in Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI support, and instant Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
- 🛡️ **Enterprise Ready**: Baked-in JWT authentication and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

## ✨ Features

- **Blazing Fast Bundler**: Starts in less than 0.5s, even with thousands of pages.
- **Automatic Caching**: Drastic SQL optimization and HTML caching for lightning-fast loads.
- **Total Customization**: The module system allows for clean refactoring and easy overrides.
- **Type-Safe I18n**: Auto-generated TypeScript definitions for your translation keys.
- **Docker Ready**: Includes scripts to containerize your app into a lightweight VM in seconds.

## 🏗️ Architecture

JopiJS follows a "Core + Plugins" philosophy. Everything from authentication to UI modules can be packaged as a plugin, making big websites much easier to maintain and refactor.
